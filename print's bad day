meet print, the yapper and input, the polite.
input says, hey what are you doing print?
I am trying to find string and perantacie before terminal finds out that I am talking against the rules! says print
You see, string and perantacie were the only way print was allowed to talk, so without them, terminal would get confused and very mad if print
talked.string was trying to find his brother, strings, so he wouldnt have to do his part, well, string told his brother that he wanted
print to be more efficient. And perantacie was actualy doing something good, because he was looking for his sister so that he woudnt get 
terminal mad, you see, if he was by himself he just made everything worse, because everbody knows one perantacie is no good.
Anyway, so print is looking for peratacie and string, input helps, but there is no luck, until terminal comes in and checks print's history!
WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED!!said terminal.I thought I could trust you! terminal screamed.
well, print says I am looking for string and perantacie.WELL CAN YOU FIND THEM ALREADY, ITS ALWAYS ON YOUR MORNING ROUTINE AND ITS JUST LIKE HUMANS BRUSH 
THEIR TEETH EVER DAY, SAME THING, NOW FIND THEM! says terminal
well I tried to but... input cuts him off
well, what happend was print woke up and they were gone, now can you shut up! says input
hey, why would you have string, input, and you have perantacie, you are both in big trouble! says terminal
no,no,no, I use strings, not string and everbody knows theres infinity of perantacies! input says
well then where is string!!?? says terminal
