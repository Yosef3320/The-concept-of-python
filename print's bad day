meet print, the yapper and input, the polite.
input says, hey what are you doing print?
I am trying to find string before terminal finds out that I am talking against the rules! says print
You see, string and perantacie were the only way print was allowed to talk, so without them, terminal would get confused and very mad if print
talked.string was going to a perade.And perantacie was actualy doing something else, because he was looking for his sister so that he woudnt get 
terminal mad, you see, if he was by himself he just made everything worse, because everbody knows one perantacie is no good.
Anyway, so print is looking for peratacie and string, input helps, but there is no luck, until terminal comes in and checks print's history!
WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED!!said terminal.I thought I could trust you! terminal screamed.
well, print says I am looking for string and perantacie.WELL CAN YOU FIND THEM ALREADY, ITS ALWAYS ON YOUR MORNING ROUTINE AND ITS JUST LIKE HUMANS BRUSH 
THEIR TEETH EVER DAY, SAME THING, NOW FIND THEM! says terminal
well I tried to but... input cuts him off
well, what happend was print woke up and they were gone, now can you shut up! says input
hey, why would you have string, input, and you have perantacie, you are both in big trouble! says terminal
no,no,no, I use strings, not string and everbody knows theres almost infinity of strings and perantacies! input says
well then where is string!!?? says terminal
I think I heard someone saying that all string and strings are having a perade!said input
well that's not so thoughtfull of string that he didn't tell me!says print
WELL IF THEY ARE HAVING A PERADE, THEN WHY IS INPUT TALKING?!screams terminal
I'm using variable's right now, so don't look at me.said input
