meet print, the yapper and input, the polite.
input says, hey what are you doing print?
I am trying to find string and perantacie before terminal finds out that I am talking against the rules! says print
You see, string and perantacie were the only way print was allowed to talk, so without them, terminal would get confused and very mad if print
talked.Anyway string was trying to find his brother, strings, so he wouldnt have to do his part, well, string told his brother that he wanted
print to be more efficient. And perantacie was actualy doing something good, because he was looking for his sister so that he woudnt get 
terminal mad, you see, if he was by himself he just made everything worse, because everbody knows one perantacie is no good.
